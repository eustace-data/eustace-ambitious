This is a copy of the fmesher subdirectory of the
  https://bitbucket.org/hrue/r-inla
repository.

If
  make
fails due to lack of X11 librarires, then do
  make clean
  make -D"FMESHER_NO_X=1"

Optionally,
  make doc
builds basic Doxygen documentation in
  doc/fmesher-refman.pdf
  html/index.html
Most of the output is auto-generated, but the mesh algorithm methods
tend to have much more detail and sometimes references.

Then,
  ./fmesher --help
should show the command line options.
See the .conf file in the examples directory for a simple call.

All practical use of the program is via a more user-friendly R
interface, part of the INLA package, with binary files used for
communication (even though fmesher was intended to be used as a
library, the monolithic program interface was how it turned out).

The program was designed to build refined Delaunay triangulations on
R2 and S2 (sphere), but the "smorg" options can be used used to answer
queries about an existing mesh.

In R, install INLA with
  install.packages("INLA", repos="https://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/R/testing")

In R,
  mesh <- INLA::inla.mesh.create(globe=8)
creates a subdivided (and deformed) icosahedron, and
  A <- INLA::inla.spde.make.A(mesh, locations)
constructs the location-to-mesh mapping. To get more meta-information
(what triangle is the point in, etc),
  proj <- INLA::inla.mesh.projector(mesh, locations)
